Team Project for IS201 - Fundamentals of Computing

Project Description: Each team of 2-3 students is required to write a Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) program implemented in Python as a team. There are multiple intermediate submissions based on their progress (please see the details of each submission below). During the game, a user will interact with a computer to play the game. Once a user chooses to play first or second and the label (X or O), then the game begins. As the game progresses, the computer can choose its placement in an empty spot in a random way or using a certain algorithm (e.g. rule-based or minimax algorithm) for an extra point. Your program then displays the board with one of three labels (O, X or predefined position number, and no blank cell please). In each turn, a user knows the available spots to place his/her mark. While the game is being played, your program should monitor the status of the game so that you either proceed for the next turn or to end if there is a winner or draw with appropriate message. 

Project Requirements:
1. Selection of the first player. (e.g. Would you like to play first?)
2. Assignment of "O" or "X" for a user. (e.g. Please choose 'O' or 'X' for your turn.)
3. Computer selects a position based on either random position. 
4. If computer can select a position based on an algorithm (e.g. MiniMax algorithm or rule-based) approach, you will earn 20 extra points.
5. At each run, the program should display the board (3x3) as shown below. Placement is made based on the pre-assigned positional number.
6. Your program prints appropriate message if there is a winner and then exits.
7. Your program saves all the moves between players in a file called tictactoe.txt (X:5 O:2 X:1 O:9 etc...)
8. Your program should handle incorrect inputs (e.g. input validation) and continue to play without an error.
Submission: There are multiple submissions for TP. Student should upload a pseudocode for overall structure (the flow of logic) in text stating how you approach to implement at high level for choosing a player, displaying a board, monitoring a winner, input validation and file logging for the submission #1. Submission #2 would require a Python code implementation choosing a player and displaying a board at minimum with proper comments (reuse the pseudocode from the earlier submission). This code doesn't need to be run properly acknowledging that it is work in progress. The instructor will review what is in the code rather than executing the code necessarily. However, the final submission is expected to run properly without an error. And the final submission includes two parts, (1) a complete Python code meeting all the requirements and (2) a 10-min video presentation. Please note that copying a segment of code from the Internet and submitting it as your work is considered as plagiarism.

Create a Public GitHub repository to host team projects, each team member must contribute to the same repository to receive credit. Team project requires individual submission with a Word document describing individual contributions and a GitHub repository link.

Submission1: Pseudo-code of overall structures, Choosing a player, displaying a board and input validation methods. Define your next steps.

Submission2: Defining the routine that takes turns, and processes the input positions and updates the board and your datatypes. Adding file logging routine. Define your next steps.

Submission3 & 4: Final submission (Python code and 10min video presentation)
